# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

This project was completed as part of the data analysis bootcamp at Ironhack and focused on a Kaggle machine learning competition centered around predicting Airbnb prices based on provided data.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to develop a predictive model for Airbnb prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprised two main CSV files:

- `train.csv`: This file contained the dataset used for training the model. It included various features along with corresponding Airbnb prices.
- `test.csv`: This file lacked the price information and was used to make predictions based on the trained model.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for reading and manipulating the CSV files.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: These libraries were employed for data exploration, visualization, and transformation.

## Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**: The project initiated with the exploration of the provided Airbnb dataset. Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were used to understand the features, distributions, and correlations within the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary feature engineering.

3. **Model Training**: Utilized `train.csv` to train a machine learning model. The `LinearRegression` algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and initial predictive capability.

4. **Predictions**: Applied the trained model to `test.csv` to predict Airbnb prices based on the features present in the test dataset.

5. **Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluated the model's performance metrics and iteratively optimized the model by potentially exploring other algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, or feature selection techniques.
